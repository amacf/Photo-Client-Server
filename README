CS3516 Prog3: Photo Client

The goal of this assignment is to send sets of digital photographs from multiple clients
to a photograph gallery server. The two programs included are written in accordance to
the specification provided by Professor Kinicki at WPI for CS3516 B-Term Program 3.

To compile the programs, simply use the included Makefile with GNU make. This will
compile on any of the CCC linux machines used for testing.

To run the client, use the command line format: 
	./client servermachine id num_photos
where
	-servermachine specifies the logical name for the server machine 
		(e.g., cccWORK4.wpi.edu).
 	-id is a unique integer identifying this client.
 	-num_photos indicates the number of photos this client wants to upload to
 		the Photo Server.

To run the server, simply use:
	./server


The following notes specify implementation and usage for this submission:
	- The client will produce a log file named client_id.log, where id is passed
		to the program upon startup as an argument
	- The server will produce a log file for each client, named server_id.log,
		where id is the id specified by the connected client
	- The ID is sent as 1-byte to the server before any frames are sent
	- Every frame sent by the client is preceded by a single byte encoding the
		length (in bytes) of the frame that follows it.
	- Sending the same photo over the server twice will overwrite and corrupt the
		photo sent on the first send. This is necessary by limitation of design.
	- Due to the contrived nature of this assignment, the transmission will take a
		considerably long time. A 1Mb photo may take up to a few minutes. This
		is due to the false errors that require frequent ACKS, as the
		communication is significantly faster when disabling false errors.
	- Photos to be sent MUST use the proper name format provided in specification
	- Artificial errors are induced by NOTing this last byte of the frame
	- Well known port is 6430, defined in prog3.h as WELLKNOWNPORT
